Assignment of this week:
1. Mangage the layout of Gui to separate it into 3 blocks: initial neuron setting(weight, bias, ta, trf and so on), input setting(things about input), visualization setting(speed, stop, go, restart, exit).
2. Try different settings to make various neuron patterns and record them(in words and video).
